# aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy

Provides a [Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) lifecycle policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-lifecycle.html) for managing snapshots.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "dlm_lifecycle_role" {
  name = "dlm-lifecycle-role"

  assume_role_policy = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "dlm.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Sid": ""
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}

resource "aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy" "example" {
  description        = "example DLM lifecycle policy"
  execution_role_arn = "${aws_iam_role.dlm_lifecycle_role.arn}"
  state              = "ENABLED"

  policy_details {
    resource_types = ["VOLUME"]

    schedule {
      name = "2 weeks of daily snapshots"

      create_rule {
        interval      = 24
        interval_unit = "HOURS"
        times         = ["23:45"]
      }

      retain_rule {
        count = 14
      }

      tags_to_add {
        SnapshotCreator = "DLM"
      }
    }

    target_tags {
      Snapshot = "true"
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `description` - (Required) A description for the DLM lifecycle policy.
* `execution_role_arn` - (Required) The ARN of an IAM role that is able to be assumed by the DLM service.
* `policy_details` - (Required) See the [`policy_details` configuration](#policy-details-arguments) block. Max of 1.
* `state` - (Optional) Whether the lifecycle policy should be enabled or disabled. `ENABLED` or `DISABLED` are valid values. Defaults to `ENABLED`.

#### Policy Details arguments

* `resource_types` - (Required) A list of resource types that should be targeted by the lifecycle policy. `VOLUMES` is currently the only allowed value.
* `schedule` - (Required) See the [`schedule` configuration](#schedule-arguments) block.
* `target_tags` (Required) A mapping of tag keys and their values. Any resources that match the `resource_types` and are tagged with _any_ of these tags will be targeted.

~> Note: You cannot have overlapping lifecycle policies that share the same `target_tags`. Terraform is unable to detect this at plan time but it will fail during apply.

#### Schedule arguments

* `create_rule` - (Required) See the [`create_rule`](#create-rule-arguments) block. Max of 1 per schedule.
* `name` - (Required) A name for the schedule.
* `retain_rule` - (Required) See the [`create_rule`](#create-rule-arguments) block. Max of 1 per schedule.
* `tags_to_add` - (Optional) A mapping of tag keys and their values. DLM lifecycle policies will already tag the snapshot with the tags on the volume. This configuration adds extra tags on top of these.

#### Create Rule arguments

* `interval` - (Required) How often this lifecycle policy should be evaluated. `12` or `24` are valid values.
* `interval_unit` - (Optional) The unit for how often the lifecycle policy should be evaluated. `HOURS` is currently the only allowed value and also the default value.
* `times` - (Optional) A list of times in 24 hour clock format that sets when the lifecycle policy should be evaluated. Max of 1.

#### Retain Rule arguments

* `count` - (Required) How many snapshots to keep. Must be an integer between 1 and 1000.

## Attributes Reference

All of the arguments above are exported as attributes.

## Import

DLM lifecyle policies can be imported by their policy ID:

```
$ terraform import aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy.example policy-abcdef12345678901
```
